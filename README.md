Code snippits from an assignment for the course CAS CS 582 Geometry Processing at Boston University GRS.
Description:
A set of functions to implement different types of normal functions and curvatures for a mesh.

I haven't added the header file (Curvature.hh) since it contains starter code but the contents of it are pretty straighforward.
